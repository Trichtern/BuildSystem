## Introduction

**BuildSystem** is a simple but powerful - as the name already says - system for builders, with lots of great features
for everyday usage. Manage worlds in the worlds navigator, change their permission, projects and status with ease. And
not to forget: let each player decide which settings whey think are best for them and now the building can start!

## Full guide

You can find a full guide with tutorials, commands and permissions [here](https://eintosti.gitbook.io/buildsystem/).

## Features

- Fancy GUIs
- 100% customisable messages

          forget _**archive**_ and finally _**hidden**_
- When in worlds that are set as finished, the player is invisible and can fly in adventure mode, so they can only have
  a look without breaking anything [bypass: `/build`]
